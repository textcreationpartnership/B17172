            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>ANSWERS For <hi>James Anderson</hi> and <hi>Agnes Campbell</hi> his Mother, To the Complaint Exhibite against them before the Lords of Their Majesties Privy Council.</head>
            <p>THat where the Defenders are conveened as Contemners of Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Authority, in Exercing the Office of printing Proclamations of Council, and other things that belongs to the Office of Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Printers, without taking the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Certificat</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be taken by Persons in Publick Trust; and that therefore they should be Deprived of the said Office, and Ordained to find such Security for their good Behaviour as your Lordships shall think fit.</p>
            <p>It is humbly represented to your Lordships, That the second Act of the first Session of this Parliament appoints only persons in Publick Trust, either Civil or Military, to take the <hi>Oath of Allegiance;</hi> and the Office of King's Printer cannot be constructed a Publick Trust, since they have not the Power to Print what they please, and can only Print the Acts of Parliament and Council, and other Papers relating to Publick Affairs, which are Licensed; so that the Government can no ways be prejudged by the Affection, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection, of Their Majesties Printer, in the Exercise of that Office, which is meerly to Print what is Ordained or Licensed by Authority.</p>
            <p>The 38 Act of the 2d Session of this Parliament, Appoints only the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat to be taken by Persons, who in Law are obliged to take the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and by all those to whom your Lordships shall put the Oath of Allegiance to. But so it is, That the Defenders not being persons in Publick Trust, appointed by the foresaid first Act of Parliament, to take the Oath of Allegiance for the Reasons foresaids; nor the Oath of Allegiance, nor Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat, not being put by your Lordships before this, to the saids Defenders, they cannot incur the Certification contained in that Act of Parliament, as refusing to subscribe the same; since Persons cannot be said to refuse to Subscribe till they be Interpelled, and Required to do the same: And if your Lordships do now require the same, the Defender <hi>James Anderson,</hi> and <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> who is Assigned by <hi>Agnes Campbel</hi> to her Liferent of the Tack, are most willing to swear the Oath of Allegiance, and subscribe it, and the Certificat, as a Mark of their Affection to Their Majesties Government, if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships shall require it.</p>
            <p>As for your Lordships Proclamation Lybelled on, it is so far from being an Argument of the Defenders contempt of their Majesties Authority, in not taking the saids Oaths against the times therein prefixt, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair, it is a ground of Defence for them, against the present Complaint; since your Lordships by that Act, (if the Defenders, as Printers to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, had been Persons in publick Trust) would have enumerat them as such, when there are so many several kinds of Publick Trust enumerat, as Sheriffs, Commissars, Stewarts, Bailies of Bailiaries, and Regalities, Magistrats of Burghs, their Deputs, Clerks, and Clerk deputs, Fiscals, Justices of Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Defenders not being enumerat, as Persons in Publick Trust, cannot be reput guilty of Contempt, to infer such a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, as the loss of their Office, because they took not the said Oath, and Certificat, betwixt and the day prefixt by the said Proclamation: Or if your Lordships had looked upon the Defenders as Disaffected, your Lordships would have expresly Interpelled, and Required them, either by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, or some other way, which not being done till now, and the Persons above-named, who have now Right to the said Gift, being willing to take the Oaths, they cannot be Deprived of that Office, which is their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, being Granted under the Great Seal, and Ratified in Parliament.</p>
